# Chess
# chessboard
Recreated the game chess (without the chess library). You play chess against yourself. This project was for me to give myself the permission to use the chess library in the future and to show I can do these tedious tasks.

done:
- Board 
- add pieces
- moveset of pieces
- Pieces move correctly

NOT there:
- winconditions(checkmate->game over)
- castle, enpassant 
- show check/checkmate
- clock(+increment)
- turn board
- bots

Notes:
There have to be better ways to do the things I do(there is a lot of tedious work I have to do), but this is my 2. time using pygames and I don't know better (jet).
The constant coonversions of the idx is quite annoying, but i wanted to use the chess idx(start is botttom left).
