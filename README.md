# Chess
## Chessboard
Recreated the game chess (without the chess library). You can play chess against yourself. It is very simplistic. I wrote this program before learning about design principles etc. so there is a lot of repeating code and technical dept.

done:
- Board 
- add pieces
- moveset of pieces
- Pieces move correctly

NOT there:
- winconditions(checkmate->game over)
- castle, enpassant 
- show check/checkmate
- clock(+increment)
- turn board
- bots
- online vs.

Notes:
The constant coonversions of the idx is quite annoying, but i wanted to use the chess idx(start is botttom left).
